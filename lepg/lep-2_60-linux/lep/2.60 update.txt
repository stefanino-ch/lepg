IMPROVEMENTS INTRODUCED IN 2.60 VERSION "Les Escaules" 2016-12-12

1) Corrected some problems using an even number of cells

When we define paragliders using an even number of cells, the central profile has a coordinate x = 0.0 along span, and program use internally a "virtual centrall cell" with a zero thickness. 

This can cause some numerical errors when calculating angles or divisions by zero. The result is usually an unreadable DXF file. Now, if the central profile located at x = 0.0, the program adds internally +0.01 cm (a tenth of a millimeter) and it seems that there are no numerical errors. [Section 4.2 in source code file .f].

2) Lines labels

The labels of the lines now automatically written on the schematic drawing in the form of tree. This prevents errors, and had to The labels of the lines now automatically written on the schematic drawing in the form of tree.
